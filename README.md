Script for wallpaper change by [T3RRY](https://www.dostips.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=10296) from [DosTips forum](https://www.dostips.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=10296)

Made to be used together to change wallpaper from a folder or any of their subfloders in windows 10/11

# Instructions
- You will have to change the YOUR-WALLPAPERS-FOLDER part in the random_file.bat script to the folder containing the pictures from which you want the wallpaper to be selected  
**IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THIS FOLDER AND ALL OF ITS SUBFLODERS CONTAIN ONLY IMAGES FOR THIS TO WORK**

- You will also have to change the REPO-FOLDER part of the script to the path in which you placed the downloaded repo

# Running the script
To change the wallpaper you simply have ro run the random_file.bat file

- **Run via key combination**  
  If you want to execute the script via a key combination you can simply create a shortcut to random_file.bat and right click on it>properties>shortcut>shortcut key click on the field and perform the key combination of your choosing then apply
  
- **Run at startup**  
  If you want to run the script at startup you will need to create a shortcut to random_file.bat (or you can move the one you already created if you choose to assign a key combination) and place it in your start-up folder  
  You can find your startup folder by opening a run window (Win+R or search run in the search bar) and running shell:startup in it


# Disclaimer
I am not well versed in windows batch files syntax since I am mainly a Linux user so if anyone has any improvements to the scripts feel free to reach out
