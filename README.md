Script for wallpaper change by [T3RRY](https://www.dostips.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=10296) from [DosTips forum](https://www.dostips.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=10296)

Made to be used together to change wallpaper from a folder or any of their subfloders in windows 11 and I am pretty sure 10 too

You will have to change the YOUR-WALLPAPERS-FOLDER and the REPO-FOLDER parts in the random_file.bat script to the folder containing the pictures from which you want the wallpaper to be selected
IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THIS FOLDER AND ALL OF ITS SUBFLODERS CONTAIN ONLY IMMAGES FOR THIS TO WORK

You will also have to change the REPO-FOLDER part of the script to the path in which you placed the downloaded repo

I am not well versed in windows batch files syntax since I am mainly a Linux user so if anyone has any improvements to the scripts feel free to reach out
